## Problem: Two Sum

**Description:**
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
You may assume that each input will have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Approach:

The solution uses a HashMap (dictionary) to store previously seen numbers and their indices. For each number, we calculate its complement and check if it has been encountered before.

### Time Complexity:

O(n) - where n is the length of the `nums` list.

### Space Complexity:

O(n) - due to the HashMap storing indices.


## Problem: 3Sum

**Description:**

Given an array of integers `nums`, return all unique triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that:

* `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`
* `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

### Approach:

The solution first sorts the array to simplify finding triplets. It then iterates through each element, using the two-pointer technique to find pairs that sum to the complement of the current element. Duplicate triplets are avoided by skipping duplicate values for the fixed element and the pointers.

### Time Complexity:

* **Sorting:** `O(n log n)`
* **Two-pointer approach:** For each element, we use the two-pointer technique to find other two elements, making the total time complexity for the two-pointer approach `O(n)`.
* **Overall Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.

### Space Complexity:

* **Auxiliary Space:** `O(1)` for the two-pointer technique.
* **Result Storage:** `O(k)`, where `k` is the number of triplets found, which can be at most `O(n^2)`.
